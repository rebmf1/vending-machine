# Vending Machine

This is a simple Java implementation that assumes that only one person can interact with the vending machine at any given time (i.e. there is no support for running in a multi-threaded environment).

The VendingMachine class is the entry point for all interaction. All use cases are tested in the VendingMachineTest class.
